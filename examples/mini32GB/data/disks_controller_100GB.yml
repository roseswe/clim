  disk-models:
  - name: CONTROLLER-100GB-DISKS

    # This example is based on using a single 600GB disk for a volume
    # group that contains all file systems on a controller with 64GB
    # of memory.  This represents a mimimal Ardana system with very
    # Limited capacity
    #
    # Additional disks can be added to the 'physical-volumes' section.
    #
    # If the available capacity of your servers is more that 600GB you
    # should consider using the "CONTROLLER-1TB-DISKS" disk-model
    # in disks_controller_1TB.yml instead.  To use this alternative model
    # you need to edit the CONTROLLER-ROLE sections of server_roles.yml
    #

          # NOTE: 'sda_root' is a templated value. This value is checked in

          #e.g. sda1 or sda5
          - /dev/sda_root

          # Add any additional disks for the volume group here
